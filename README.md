Small CLI application to introduce Saga pattern.  
[Prooph/service-bus](https://github.com/prooph/service-bus) was used for handling messages (commands, domain events) purpose.    
 
Inspired by:
- **Modeling complex processes and time with Saga pattern** talk by [Mariusz Gil](https://twitter.com/mariuszgil) performed on [2017.phpce](https://2017.phpce.eu) conference
- [Saga on sagas](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34774) section from a book "Exploring CQRS and Event Sourcing"
- [broadway/broadway-saga](https://github.com/broadway/broadway-saga) nice repo with saga implementation
